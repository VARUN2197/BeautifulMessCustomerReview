The servers were very friendly careful and clearly cared about the experience we were having. However they were not fast or efficient. Food was very good, large portions as well.

The place is very spacious, the decoration is very modern and the choice of music playlists is well chosen. Having gone there on a Sunday lunchtime, the restaurant was relatively empty. The only slightly negative point is the price, the main dishes come without accompaniments, which increases the bill if you add one or more accompaniments. However the food is very good so you get what you pay for."},
